Final Project for CS328


Our idea for our final project has to do with pushups. Pushups are a common and fairly easy bodyweight exercise that can be performed by most anyone for general 
fitness and working out their chest. What we would do would be to recognize pushups being done based on analysis of sensor data, count the amount of pushups done 
(using a certain standardized measurement program designed by us) in a specific amount of time. We would could the amount of pushups performed and suggest to the 
user a realistic exercise goal to increase the amount of pushups they can do in general.
